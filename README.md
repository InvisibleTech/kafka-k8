# Greetings

I am sharing this in case it helps others get a local, multi-broker Kafaka cluster up and running for learning and eplxoration.

# How Did I Develop This?

This code was developed in small part by myself - first real Kubernetes from scratch thing... and heavily
iterating with Claude AI. The other readme makes that clear. The goal of pushing it was to keep it. The intention is for me to go through the yamls and get a better picture of what we have here. Unfortunately I did this a while ago locally when it was fesh in my mind and I could have explained it better off the top of my head.

The journey of it is briefly explained in [my blog](https://aninvisiblefriend.com/) post [Riding in the Trunk of The Mach 5](https://aninvisiblefriend.com/riding-in-the-trunk-of-the-mach5-aa86cfbda8e0). Later posts do more technical break down such as [Exquisite Corpse: StatefulSet](https://aninvisiblefriend.com/exquisite-corpse-statefulset-39305efad022).
