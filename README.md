This code was developed in small part by myself - first real Kubernetes from scratch thing... and heavily
iterating with Claude AI. The other readme makes that clear. The goal of pushing it was to keep it. The intention
is for me to go through the yamls and get a better picture of what we have here. Unfortunately I did this a while
ago locally when it was fesh in my mind and I could have explained it better off the top of my head.
